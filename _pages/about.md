I am an assistant professor in the [Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences](https://pbs.dartmouth.edu/) at [Dartmouth College](https://www.dartmouth.edu/). My lab uses fMRI to study individual differences in brain activity and connectivity and how these relate to behavior. Specifically, we are investigating how naturalistic task paradigms may be used to draw out individual variation of interest, in both healthy people and those with or at risk for psychiatric illness.

Prior to Dartmouth, I completed my PhD in neuroscience at Yale University in 2017. My thesis work demonstrated that each individual has a functional connectivity ‘fingerprint’ that is both unique and reliable across various brain states, and that features of these signatures predict high-level cognitive traits such as fluid intelligence. I then did a postdoctoral fellowship in the [Section on Functional Imaging Methods](https://fim.nimh.nih.gov) at the National Institute of Mental Health.
